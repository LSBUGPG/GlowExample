I couldn't get the post processing effects to work on the camera. I searched the forums for an answer, and there were many reasons given for many different versions of Unity and the post processing system, but none matched my problem.

Experimenting with the system I found that the effects were turned off when I thought they were turned on. Toggling them on and off demonstrated the issue. The problem are that the buttons are inverted with respect to their visual look and the buttons don't act like individual buttons but like a single toggle switch.
